										<h3>Natural ventilation to clean the air inside living hall</h3>
										<p>Due to the small unit size, at certain times, during heavier cooking, it is important to ensure air which has a cooking oil smell do not linger within the main living area. Other than using the cooking hood, to further clear the air, follow the steps below: </p>										
										<ul>
											<li>Slightly open the main front door</li>
											<li>Switch on the ventilation fan.</li>
											<li>Open the main sliding door.</li>
										</ul>
                                           <p>There will be a strong wind draft each time this is done , thus quickly improving air circulation in the unit. Standing at the door entrance will confirm this as you feel the breeze.</p>
